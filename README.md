## Project Overview  

**Syscall Proxy** is an open-source research project developed by **TITAN Softwork Solutions** with inspiration from [MDSEC](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/), SysWhisperer & Hellsgate.  

This implements a stub-based internal syscall dispatcher which bypasses all usermode hooks and sidesteps lower level kernel API's (EDR/AC/AV evasion tech)

This project is powered by **ActiveBreach**, a dedicated syscall execution we built framework that:
- Dynamically extracts **system service numbers (SSNs)** from `ntdll.dll`
- Constructs **syscall stubs** for direct execution
- Uses a **dispatcher model** to invoke syscalls without routing through user-mode APIs
- Leverages a **callback** to prevent debugging.

For a technical breakdown on how hooks work, see > [TECH.md](TECH.md).

### Why did I make this?

When approaching a guarded or monitored system, the usual move is to unhook everything aggressive method that’s easily detected in various ways. Sure, sophisticated techniques exist. But they often introduce unnecessary complexity and risk, leaving gaps for detection. I've taken a different approach, enter Syscall Proxy.

# Bypasses

## **Driverless**  

| **Bypass**                                      | **Description**                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global hooks on `ntdll.dll`**                 | Reads `ntdll.dll` directly into buffer, bypassing any API's monitoring lib loading.    |
| **Remote process `ntdll.dll` hooks**            | Uses internal ActiveBreach dispatcher instead of calling hooked `ntdll.dll` directly.  |
| **Partial YARA/CADA evasion**                   | Minimizes `ntdll.dll` presence in memory by zeroing out portions.                      |

## **Kernel Driver**  

| **Sidestep**                       | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine**    | Loads `ntdll.dll` manually, avoiding kernel notifications (`PsApi`).        |
| **MmLoadSystemImage**              | Maps `ntdll.dll` manually, preventing system image load tracking.           |


### **Normal hooked API call**
```
User Process
    │
    ├──▶ CreateFile (Wrapper, kernel32.dll)
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │    NtCreateFile (ntdll.dll)   <─── [Hooked by AntiVirus/AntiCheat]
    │         │ 
    │         ▼
    │   [Hook Handler]  <─── (Monitoring, logging, blocking, etc...)
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │  Kernel (Syscall)  <─── (Actual system call after handling)
    │ 
    ▼ 
  Return 
```

### **ActiveBreach API call**
```
User Process
    │
    ├──▶ ab_call("NtCreateFile")  <─── (Not using "CreateFile" as ActiveBreach only supports Nt functions)
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │  Kernel (Syscall)  <─── (Direct system call without passing through `ntdll.dll`)
    │ 
    ▼ 
  Return
```

# **Using ActiveBreach (C & C++)**

---

## ActiveBreach Usage

### 1. Include the Appropriate Header
- **C++ Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.hpp` and link with `ActiveBreach.cpp`:
  ```cpp
  #include <ActiveBreach.hpp>
  ```
- **C/C++ Universal Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.h` and link with `ActiveBreach.c`:
  ```c
  #include "ActiveBreach.h"
  ```

### 2. Initialize ActiveBreach
Call the initialization function **before** any syscalls:
- **C++ Example (optional "LMK" prints a status message):**
  ```cpp
  ActiveBreach_launch("LMK");
  ```
- **C/C++ Example:**
  ```c
  ActiveBreach_launch();
  ```
This function maps `ntdll.dll`, extracts syscall numbers, builds syscall stubs, and sets up the system.

### 3. Making a System Call
Use the `ab_call` macro to invoke syscalls dynamically. You must supply:
- The NT function type
- The syscall name
- The required arguments

**Example for NtQuerySystemInformation:**
```cpp
NTSTATUS status;
status = ab_call(NtQuerySystemInformation_t, "NtQuerySystemInformation", infoClass, buffer, bufferSize, &returnLength);
```
*(For C, the syntax is similar but might pass the status as an additional parameter.)*

### 4. Cleanup
No manual cleanup is needed—resources are automatically released at program exit.

## Requirements:
- Win11/10, x64
- MSVC, C++ 17/20

### Compiling
1. Open `ActiveBreach.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution
