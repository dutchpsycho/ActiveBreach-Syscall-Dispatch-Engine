## Project Overview  

**Syscall Proxy** is an open-source research project developed by **TITAN Softwork Solutions** with inspiration from [MDSEC](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/), SysWhisperer & Hellsgate.  

This implements a stub-based internal syscall dispatcher which bypasses all usermode hooks and sidesteps lower level kernel API's (EDR/AC/AV evasion tech)

This project is powered by **ActiveBreach**, a dedicated syscall execution we built framework that:
- Dynamically extracts **system service numbers (SSNs)** from `ntdll.dll`
- Constructs **syscall stubs** for direct execution
- Uses a **dispatcher model** to invoke syscalls without routing through user-mode APIs
- Leverages a **callback** to prevent debugging.

I put a lot more effort into the rust version of this project. It supports memory encryption through an internal algo, leverages it's own TLS callback and uses an MT model. If you haven't used rust before, I'd reccomend trying.

For a technical breakdown on how hooks work, see > [TECH.md](TECH.md).

### Why did I make this?

I've seen so many implementations and frameworks where the consensus is "Lets unhook everything globally in usermode andd risk getting detected by thousands of measures!". These projects aren't inherently bad, I just think there's a less aggressive and smarter way of doing it. Enter Syscall-Proxy

# Bypasses

## **Driverless**  

| **Bypass**                                      | **Description**                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global hooks on `ntdll.dll`**                 | Reads `ntdll.dll` directly into buffer, bypassing any API's monitoring lib loading.    |
| **Remote process `ntdll.dll` hooks**            | Uses internal ActiveBreach dispatcher instead of calling hooked `ntdll.dll` directly.  |
| **Partial YARA/CADA evasion**                   | Minimizes `ntdll.dll` presence in memory by zeroing out portions.                      |

The rust version fully bypasses YARA/CADA evasion unless scanned during syscall execution due to page encryption.

## **Kernel Driver**  

| **Sidestep**                       | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine**    | Loads `ntdll.dll` manually, avoiding kernel notifications (`PsApi`).        |
| **MmLoadSystemImage**              | Maps `ntdll.dll` manually, preventing system image load tracking.           |

# **Using ActiveBreach (C & C++)**

### 1. Include the Appropriate Header
- **C++ Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.hpp` and link with `ActiveBreach.cpp`:
  ```cpp
  #include <ActiveBreach.hpp>
  ```
- **C/C++ Universal Projects:**  
  Include `ActiveBreach.h` and link with `ActiveBreach.c`:
  ```c
  #include "ActiveBreach.h"
  ```

### 2. Initialize ActiveBreach
Call the initialization function **before** any syscalls:
- **C++ Example (optional "LMK" prints a status message):**
  ```cpp
  ActiveBreach_launch("LMK");
  ```
- **C/C++ Example:**
  ```c
  ActiveBreach_launch();
  ```
This function maps `ntdll.dll`, extracts syscall numbers, builds syscall stubs, and sets up the system.

### 3. Making a System Call
Use the `ab_call` macro to invoke syscalls dynamically. You must supply:
- The NT function type
- The syscall name
- The required arguments

**Example for NtQuerySystemInformation:**
```cpp
NTSTATUS status;
status = ab_call(NtQuerySystemInformation_t, "NtQuerySystemInformation", infoClass, buffer, bufferSize, &returnLength);
```
*(For C, the syntax is similar but might pass the status as an additional parameter.)*

### 4. Cleanup
No manual cleanup is needed‚Äîresources are automatically released at program exit.

yesss okay this is gonna look clean af üòÆ‚Äçüí® here's a markdown-style section u can tack onto ur docs for the **Rust** version of `ActiveBreach`‚Äîsame aesthetic, same structure as the C/C++ ones so it keeps that surgical, ‚Äúthis is a tool not a toy‚Äù energy:

<br>

# Using ActiveBreach (Rust)

### 1. Add to Cargo Project
Add **ActiveBreach** as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
activebreach = { path = "path/to/activebreach" }
```

Then include the crate in your main file:

```rust
use activebreach::{activebreach_launch, ab_call};
```

---

### 2. Initialize ActiveBreach
Before making any syscalls, call the initialization function:

```rust
activebreach_launch();
```

This:
- Maps a local `ntdll.dll`
- Extracts syscall numbers
- Builds syscall stubs
- Launches a dispatcher thread

---

### 3. Making a System Call
Use `ab_call()` to dynamically proxy a syscall. Supply:
- The syscall name (`&str`)
- A slice of up to 16 `usize` arguments

```rust
let ret = ab_call("NtProtectVirtualMemory", &[proc_handle, base_addr, region_size, protect]);
```

This sends the call to the dispatcher, which ROP-chains through a legitimate gadget inside `ntdll.dll`.

---

### 4. Cleanup
No explicit cleanup is required. All memory is zeroed and freed, and resources are released on process termination.

<br>

## Requirements:
- Win11/10, x64
- MSVC, C++ 17/20

### Compiling
1. Open `ActiveBreach.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution
