## Project Overview  

**ActiveBreach Engine** is an open-source offensive security research project developed under the **TITAN Softwork Solutions** collective, designed for undetectable syscall execution under AC/AV/EDR protected environments.  

Inspired by [MDSEC](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/), **SysWhispers**, and **Hell‚Äôs Gate**. This framework expands on their foundational concepts by going beyond hardcoded syscall lists ‚Äî implementing a full execution pipeline with dynamic stub generation, proper memory management, runtime encryption, and modern code.

---

### Why?

Most public syscall tooling falls into one of two buckets:

1. **Global Unhooking:**  
   Nuking all usermode protections via page remapping or ntdll restoration. Effective short-term ‚Äî but loud, risky, and easily behaviorally profiled by modern EDRs/AC's.

2. **Static Stub Patching:**  
   Embedding syscall stubs inline. Fast, but fragile. Prone to detection through simple memory scanning or sig-based heuristics.

---

**ActiveBreach Engine** was built on a third principle:

> *‚ÄúSidestep.‚Äù*

Rather than restoring overwritten memory, touching hooks or exploiting the kernel, ActiveBreach extracts SSN's from a clean memory copy of `ntdll.dll`, builds ephemeral execution stubs in dynamically allocated memory, and proxies all execution through an isolated, internal unlinked dispatcher thread. All syscall interactions are memory-local, thread-isolated, and AV-opaque. Rust crate also encrypts stubs at rest.

### ActiveBreach Language Implementations

#### C Edition ‚Äî *"Baremetal"*

* Designed for minimalism, portability, and raw Windows compatibility
* Syscall stubs are constructed in-place without any encryption
* Dispatcher runs on a single internal thread via `CreateThread`
* No STL or CRT dependencies ‚Äî pure WinAPI
* Ideal for small implants, loaders, or low-footprint tools

---

#### C++ Edition ‚Äî *"Enhanced"*

* Implements a dynamic syscall stub manager with hash-based lookup
* Encrypted syscall stubs are stored in the binary and decrypted on runtime
* Uses STL containers or `std::pmr` for optimal mem allocation under C++20
* Syscall dispatcher is threadpool-backed via `TP_CALLBACK_INSTANCE`, not a fixed thread
* Exception-safe, fully encapsulated in `_ActiveBreach_Internal`
* Compatible with C++14 and C++20
* Great for full-featured EDR bypass modules or internal framework integration
* Fastest execution model

---

#### Rust Edition ‚Äî *"Advanced"*

* Constructs syscall stubs dynamically at runtime, uses a ring-based stub management system
* Single threaded, fast due to spinlock system
* Least context switches between userland & kernel
* Syscall stubs are encrypted in-memory with a signatureless LEA implementation
* Designed for seamless integration into Rust-native malware frameworks or red team tools
* Securest & stealthies
* Largest footprint

## Bypasses

#### üö´ User-Mode (Driverless EDR/AV)

| **Bypass Target**              | **How It's Avoided**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ntdll.dll` inline hooks       | Loads raw `ntdll.dll` from disk manually, bypassing loader and avoiding all inline patches |
| API call heuristics            | No `Nt*`, `Zw*`, or Win32 APIs used ‚Äî all syscalls are dispatched via hashed stub indirection |
| Import resolver traps          | Nothing is dynamically resolved via `GetProcAddress` or `LoadLibrary`; all stubs are mapped from a clean image |
| `GetProcAddress` tracing       | Never used ‚Äî stub lookup and mapping is performed via internal hashed syscall table |
| User-mode hook detection       | No Win32-layer APIs are touched; all calls avoid user-mode trampolines and inline detours |
| `CreateRemoteThread` heuristics| Thread creation is done via `NtCreateThreadEx` syscall stubs, avoiding heuristic detection |
| `NtSetInformationThread` usage| Direct syscall stub used to hide threads from debuggers; no API-layer visibility |
| ETW-based telemetry            | No interaction with ETW-traced APIs (e.g. `OpenProcess`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `VirtualAllocEx`, etc.) |
| AMSI (Windows Defender)        | No use of scripting or interpreter APIs; avoids all paths that would invoke `AmsiScanBuffer` |
| Import Address Table (IAT) hooks | Does not use any imported syscall-related functions ‚Äî import table stays clean/normal |
| SEH/Vectored Exception tracing | No calls to `AddVectoredExceptionHandler` or related routines ‚Äî avoids exception chaining traps |
| Heap/stack signature detection | Syscall stubs and argument passing occur on a dedicated, obfuscated thread with custom memory layout |
| `VirtualProtect` / `VPEx` guards | RWX stub memory is committed as RW, written, then changed to RX ‚Äî minimal exposure to memory scanners |

---

#### ‚õî Kernel-Mode (Driver-Based)

| **Detection Vector**           | **Mitigation / Sidestep**                                                           |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine` | Avoided by manually reading `ntdll.dll` from disk ‚Äî no image load events fired |
| `MmLoadSystemImage` traps     | No system image mapping or section object creation is involved |
| Kernel stack traceback on caller TID         | Syscalls are dispatched from a dedicated thread ‚Äî origin call stack is never modified |
| SMEP/SMAP/KVA traps            | No kernel-mode shellcode, no ring-0 transitions attempted |
| APC injection / thread hooks on caller TID  | Dispatcher thread is unlinked, obfuscated, and not enumerated via common thread inspection routines |
| File system filter drivers    | Uses direct NT file access to read `ntdll.dll`; avoids FS minifilter interception |
| Kernel ETW provider traps     | Never touches `EtwWrite` or other kernel tracing entrypoints ‚Äî all telemetry is sidestepped |
| Hypervisor-based monitors     | Does not engage syscall shims or VM exit triggers ‚Äî low-level behavior mimics activity |
| Process creation callbacks     | No new process is created ‚Äî all execution stays in the current address space |
| PatchGuard integrity checks   | No kernel objects or memory regions are modified ‚Äî avoids all PG violations |
| DSE/CI callback hooks         | No driver loading or signature verification involved ‚Äî operates entirely in user-mode |
| CFG/XFG trapping              | No indirect control flow into unknown or untrusted pages; dispatcher thread controls all execution |
| Syscall return/ret checks     | Syscall stubs preserve expected CPU state and return cleanly; no ROP-style anomalies |

### üß¨ Detection Surface

| **Surface**              | **State**                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Hooked Kernel Functions  | **Not Bypassed** ‚Äî kernel-mode EDR hooks (e.g. SSDT, inline traps) will still trigger |
| PE Imports               | **Clean** ‚Äî no syscall-related functions resolved or used via IAT |
| Static Strings           | **Hashed/Encrypted** ‚Äî no plaintext syscall names or known IOC markers |
| API Usage                | **None (Direct Syscall Stubs)** ‚Äî completely bypasses Win32 and ntdll API layers |
| Memory Artefacts         | **Ephemeral / Zeroed** ‚Äî stub memory is wiped after use, and mapping is transient |
| Disk Presence            | **None** ‚Äî no dropped files, modules, or persistent presence on disk |
| Thread Context           | **Isolated** ‚Äî dispatcher runs in its own stealth thread, separate from caller context |

### Example: Hooked API Flow vs ActiveBreach

```
User Process
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ CreateFile (Wrapper, kernel32.dll)
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚ñº
    ‚îÇ    NtCreateFile (ntdll.dll)   <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ [Hooked by AntiVirus/AntiCheat]

    ‚îÇ         ‚ñº
    ‚îÇ   [Hook Handler]  <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Monitoring, logging, blocking, etc...)
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚ñº
    ‚îÇ  Kernel (Syscall)  <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Actual system call after handling)

    ‚ñº 
  Return

### **ActiveBreach API call**
```
User Process
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ ab_call("NtCreateFile")  <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Not using "CreateFile" as ActiveBreach only supports Nt functions)
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚ñº
    ‚îÇ  Kernel (Syscall)  <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (Direct system call without passing through `ntdll.dll`)
    ‚îÇ 
    ‚ñº 
  Return
```
